Yet today there is only one\xe2\x80\x94homo sapiens. What happened to the others? And what may happen to us?Most books about the history of humanity pursue either a historical or a biological approach, but Dr. Yuval Noah Harari breaks the mold with this highly original book that begins about 70,000 years ago with the appearance of modern cognition. From examining the role evolving humans have played in the global ecosystem to charting the rise of empires, Sapiens integrates history and science to reconsider accepted narratives, connect past developments with contemporary concerns, and examine specific events within the context of larger ideas.Dr. Harari also compels us to look ahead, because over the last few decades humans have begun to bend laws of natural selection that have governed life for the past four billion years. We are acquiring the ability to design not only the world around us, but also ourselves. Where is this leading us, and what do we want to become?Featuring 27 photographs, 6 maps, and 25 illustrations/diagrams, this provocative and insightful work is sure to spark debate and is essential reading for aficionados of Jared Diamond, James Gleick, Matt Ridley, Robert Wright, and Sharon Moalem. ...more",Image_Link:"http://books.toscrape.com/media/cache/ce/5f/ce5f052c65cc963cf4422be096e915c9.jpg",Stars:5},{"":5,Title:"The Requiem Red",Category:"Young Adult",Price:22.65,Price_After_Tax:22.65,Tax_amount:0,Avilability:19,Number_of_reviews:0,Book_Description:"Patient Twenty-nine.A monster roams the halls of Soothing Hills Asylum.

I couldn't put it down.\"---Ruth Buzzi, Golden Globe Award winner and Television Hall of Fame inductee\"Sadly, too many Americans have never heard of Victoria Woodhull, let alone learned of her story: her revolutionary campaign for the presidency at a time when women weren't even allowed to vote, her support for worker's rights, or her feminist commitment to equality, a century before the official battle over the Equal Rights Amendment. But in The Coming Woman, Karen Hicks brings Woodhull's efforts to life, and reminds us that some of our nation's greatest figures aren't always featured in the history books. It is a riveting account of an amazing woman and her struggle for justice and human dignity, told in an engaging and eminently readable style.\"-Tim Wise, author, \"White Like Me: Reflections on Race from a Privileged Son\"\"The Coming Woman\" is a novel based on the life of feminist Victoria Woodhull, the first woman to run for U.S. President, 50 years before women could even vote!Running for President wasn't Victoria's only first as a woman. She was also the first to own a successful Wall Street firm, the first to publish a successful national newspaper, and the first to head the two-million-member Spiritualist Association. She was the first woman to enter the Senate Judiciary Committee chambers to petition for woman's suffrage, her argument changing the entire focus of the suffragist movement by pointing out that the 14th and 15th Amendments already gave women the vote.In her campaign for the Presidency, Victoria Woodhull boldly addressed many of the issues we still face today: equal pay for equal work; freedom in love; corporate greed and political corruption fueled by powerful lobbyists; and the increasing disparity between the rich and the poor, to name only a few. Her outspoken and common-sense ideas may shed a new perspective on the parallel conundrums of today's world.This bold, beautiful, and sexually progressive woman dared to take on society and religion. To make an example of the hypocrisy in what Mark Twain dubbed The Gilded Age, she exposed the extramarital affairs of the most popular religious figure of the day (Henry Ward Beecher). This led to her persecution and imprisonment and the longest, most infamous trial of the 19th century. But it did not stop her fight for equality.Victoria's epic story, set in the late 1800s, comes to life in a modern, fictional style, while staying true to the actual words and views of the many well-known characters. ...more",Image_Link:"http://books.toscrape.com/media/cache/97/36/9736132a43b8e6e3989932218ef309ed.jpg",Stars:3},{"":8,Title:"The Boys in the Boat: Nine Americans and Their Epic Quest for Gold at the 1936 Berlin Olympics",Category:"Default",Price:22.6,Price_After_Tax:22.6,Tax_amount:0,Avilability:19,Number_of_reviews:0,Book_Description:"For readers of Laura Hillenbrand's Seabiscuit and Unbroken, the dramatic story of the American rowing team that stunned the world at Hitler's 1936 Berlin Olympics Daniel James Brown\xe2\x80\x99s robust book tells the story of the University of Washington\xe2\x80\x99s 1936 eight-oar crew and their epic quest for an Olympic gold medal, a team that transformed the sport and grabbed the attention o For readers of Laura Hillenbrand's Seabiscuit and Unbroken, the dramatic story of the American rowing team that stunned the world at Hitler's 1936 Berlin Olympics Daniel James Brown\xe2\x80\x99s robust book tells the story of the University of Washington\xe2\x80\x99s 1936 eight-oar crew and their epic quest for an Olympic gold medal, a team that transformed the sport and grabbed the attention of millions of Americans.

Over time, eight key technologies gradually freed us from the limitations of our animal origins.The fabrication of weapons, the mastery of fire, and the technologies of clothing and shelter radically restructured the human body, enabling us to walk upright, shed our body hair, and migrate out of tropical Africa. Symbolic communication transformed human evolution from a slow biological process into a fast cultural process. The invention of agriculture revolutionized the relationship between humanity and the environment, and the technologies of interaction led to the birth of civilization. Precision machinery spawned the industrial revolution and the rise of nation-states; and in the next metamorphosis, digital technologies may well unite all of humanity for the benefit of future generations.Synthesizing the findings of primatology, paleontology, archeology, history, and anthropology, Richard Currier reinterprets and retells the modern narrative of human evolution that began with the discovery of Lucy and other Australopithecus fossils.

Digital technology was supposed to usher in a new age of endless prosperity, but so far it has been used to put industrial capitalism on steroids, making it harder for people and businesses to keep up. Social networks surrender their original missions to more immediately profitable data mining, while brokerage houses abandon value investing for algorithms that drain markets and our 401ks alike--all tactics driven by the need to stoke growth by any means necessary. Instead of taking this opportunity to reprogram our economy for sustainability, we have doubled down on growth as its core command. We have reached the limits of this approach. We must escape the growth trap, once and for all.\xc2\xa0Media scholar and technology author Douglas Rushkoff--one of today's most original and influential thinkers--argues for a new economic program that utilizes the unique distributive power of the internet while breaking free of the winner-take-all system the growth trap leaves in its wake. Drawing on sources both contemporary and historical, Rushkoff pioneers a new understanding of the old economic paradigm, from central currency to debt to corporations and labor.Most importantly, he offers a series of practical steps for businesses, consumers, investors, and policymakers to remake the economic operating system from the inside out--and prosper along the way. Instead of boycotting Wal-Mart or overtaxing the wealthy, we simply implement strategies that foster the creation of value by stakeholders other than just ourselves. From our currency to our labor to the corporation, every aspect of the economy can be reprogrammed with minimal disruption to create a more equitably distributed prosperity for all.Inspiring and challenging, Throwing Rocks at the Google Bus provides a pragmatic, optimistic, and human-centered model for economic progress in the digital age. ...more",Image_Link:"http://books.toscrape.com/media/cache/f4/21/f4210912ca58ef35f8ad120fe3dfed38.jpg",Stars:3},{"":53,Title:"This One Summer",Category:"Sequential Art",Price:19.49,Price_After_Tax:19.49,Tax_amount:0,Avilability:16,Number_of_reviews:0,Book_Description:"Every summer, Rose goes with her mom and dad to a lake house in Awago Beach.

When her father\xe2\x80\x99s longtime attorney and one of a handful of family friends, Beth Cowling, rushes to help Andrea long distance, the youngest Harding soon finds herself surrounded by a bevy of intriguing new friends and helpers. First to arrive is Beth\xe2\x80\x99s own daughter, Riva, acting as Andrea\xe2\x80\x99s attorney after Andrea is violently attacked in her father\xe2\x80\x99s home, where she grew up, forcing her to kill both would-be assassins. When Nicholas\xe2\x80\x99s on again/off again lover, state prosecutor and gubernatorial hopeful Kerry Marcus, is equally at a loss to name suspects in the Harding family attacks, Riva begins her own investigation into the short list of family friends and colleagues, including Don Marshall, former colleague of Nicholas\xe2\x80\x99s at Marshall Pharmaceutical, which Don now runs, and Don\xe2\x80\x99s wife Karen. Marshall has a shady past, including an incident at his company that also involved Andrea\xe2\x80\x99s father. She also looks closely at Marcus Ricci, father of Andrea\xe2\x80\x99s closest high school friend, Jason. After Jason\xe2\x80\x99s death from leukemia, Ricci becomes like a second father to Andrea. Ricci is also widely believed to have ties to the New Jersey mob. But Beth has another contact she wants involved in the investigation, Deirdre Southington, daughter of Beth\xe2\x80\x99s old friend Cordelia Southington. The Southington family has more money than God, as well as, through Deirdre, more contacts in the intriguing world of international espionage. A former NSA agent, Deirdre is mysterious and beautiful in a cold way. An eccentric who travels via private rail car, she is also extraordinarily persuasive, holding a PhD in forensic psychology that she has put to great use in both her work with the NSA and on her own, as a defender of good, rooting out evil doers and ensuring they are brought to her own brand of justice. Andrea, Riva, and Deirdre all also cast a suspicious eye on the Oakes brothers, Carlton and Jefferson, who run Oakes Industries along with their silent partner and cousin, New Jersey state senator Schuyler Colfax, who also has his eye on the governor\xe2\x80\x99s seat. Oakes Industries has recently made an attempt to purchase Harding Industries, a seemingly irrational move that is rebuffed by Nicholas. What no one knows until much later is that the Oakes brothers have entered into a business deal with Russian mobster Viktor Roman, who represents the real party interested in acquiring Harding Industries, a Vor, Russian organized crime unit, with heavy international interests in the energy sector. Andrea matures quickly as she rapidly learns who she can and cannot trust during her search for the people out to kill her family. Along with her new friends and advocates, she discovers Harding Industries holds a soon to expire option to buy property that could become the source of untold billions from oil reserves, and moves in the nick of time to exercise their right to purchase. But the biggest blow for the Harding family is yet to come\xe2\x80\x94the discovery that Viktor Roman has promised Kerry Marcus the governor\xe2\x80\x99s seat in exchange for information about the Hardings, including Nicholas and Michael\xe2\x80\x99s whereabouts on the night they are shot. Ultimately, Andrea chooses to forego law school and becomes her father\xe2\x80\x99s new partner in Harding Industries, no doubt with many adventures yet to come. Masterfully told using a smattering of historical facts along with a soundtrack of classical music masterpieces, this thriller keeps readers on edge until the very end. ...more",Image_Link:"http://books.toscrape.com/media/cache/c7/26/c7260547c468dbe78af92cf3927c2a1c.jpg",Stars:1},{"":56,Title:"The Secret of Dreadwillow Carse",Category:"Childrens",Price:56.13,Price_After_Tax:56.13,Tax_amount:0,Avilability:16,Number_of_reviews:0,Book_Description:"A princess and a peasant girl must embark on a dangerous quest to outwit a centuries-old warning foretelling the fall of the Monarchy in this modern fairytale.

Within a matter of h Renowned ornithologist Tim Birkhead opens this gripping story as a female guillemot chick hatches, already carrying her full quota of tiny eggs within her undeveloped ovary. As she grows into adulthood, only a few of her eggs mature, are released into the oviduct, and are fertilized by sperm stored from copulation that took place days or weeks earlier. Within a matter of hours, the fragile yolk is surrounded by albumen and the whole is gradually encased within a turquoise jewel of a shell. Soon afterward the fully formed egg is expelled onto a bare rocky ledge, where it will be incubated for four weeks before another chick emerges and the life cycle begins again. A Bird's Egg is about how eggs in general are made, fertilized, developed, and hatched. The eggs of most birds spend just 24 hours in the oviduct; however, that journey takes 48 hours in cuckoos, which surreptitiously lay their eggs in the nests of other birds. From the earliest times, the study of birds' ovaries and ova (eggs) played a vital role in the quest to unravel the mysteries of fertilization and embryo development in humans. Birkhead uses birds' eggs as wondrous portals into natural history, enlivened by the stories of naturalists and scientists, including Birkhead and his students, whose discoveries have advanced current scientific knowledge of reproduction. ...more",Image_Link:"http://books.toscrape.com/media/cache/a3/9e/a39e7c5c9fc61c2ae0f81116aa8cbb0e.jpg",Stars:4},{"":63,Title:"The Mindfulness and Acceptance Workbook for Anxiety: A Guide to Breaking Free from Anxiety, Phobias, and Worry Using Acceptance and Commitment Therapy",Category:"Add a comment",Price:23.89,Price_After_Tax:23.89,Tax_amount:0,Avilability:16,Number_of_reviews:0,Book_Description:"Is anxiety and fear a problem for you?

It was a time of creativity unparalleled in history before or since, from science to the arts, from philosophy to politics. Acclaimed philosopher and historian A.C. Grayling points to three primary factors that led to the rise of vernacular (popular) languages in philosophy, theology, science, and literature; the rise of the individual as a general and not merely an aristocratic type; and the invention and application of instruments and measurement in the study of the natural world.Grayling vividly reconstructs this unprecedented era and breathes new life into the major figures of the seventeenth century intelligentsia who span literature, music, science, art, and philosophy--Shakespeare, Monteverdi, Galileo, Rembrandt, Locke, Newton, Descartes, Vermeer, Hobbes, Milton, and Cervantes, among many more. During this century, a fundamentally new way of perceiving the world emerged as reason rose to prominence over tradition, and the rights of the individual took center stage in philosophy and politics, a paradigmatic shift that would define Western thought for centuries to come. ...more",Image_Link:"http://books.toscrape.com/media/cache/2e/65/2e654066306042f4c462ba4d048650d9.jpg",Stars:1},{"":72,Title:"The Activist's Tao Te Ching: Ancient Advice for a Modern Revolution",Category:"Spirituality",Price:32.24,Price_After_Tax:32.24,Tax_amount:0,Avilability:16,Number_of_reviews:0,Book_Description:"Change and anger are in the air.

But we don't have a skilled enough labor pool to fill the positions that will be created, which are in many cases technically demanding and require specialized skills. A decades-long series of idealistic educational policies with the expressed goal of getting every student to go to college has left a generation of potential workers out of the system. Touted as a progressive, egalitarian institution providing opportunity even to those with the greatest need, the American secondary school system has in fact deepened existing inequalities.We can do better, argue acclaimed sociologists Katherine Newman and Hella Winston. Taking a page from the successful experience of countries like Germany and Austria, where youth unemployment is a mere 7%, they call for a radical reevaluation of the idea of vocational training, long discredited as an instrument of tracking. The United States can prepare a new, high-performance labor force if we revamp our school system to value industry apprenticeship and rigorous technical education. By doing so, we will not only be able to meet the growing demand for skilled employees in dozens of sectors where employers decry the absence of well trained workers -- we will make the American Dream accessible to all. ...more",Image_Link:"http://books.toscrape.com/media/cache/2c/d2/2cd2b814b8a8cd3a49895cbd13a8b1f4.jpg",Stars:2},{"":79,Title:"Rat Queens, Vol. 3: Demons (Rat Queens (Collected Editions) #11-15)",Category:"Sequential Art",Price:50.4,Price_After_Tax:50.4,Tax_amount:0,Avilability:16,Number_of_reviews:0,Book_Description:"Having survived the end of the world, the Queens follow Hannah back to where it all began: Mage University.

If you wanted to get literal, it is about an inner city boy, Sinclair, who discovers a pair of discarded angel wings. With these wings, Sinclair flies around the city and gets into adventures.\" - Farel Dalrymple, series creator From Publishers Weekly: Collecting the first five issues of Dalrymple's acclaimed comic book series Pop Gun War, this book provides a capsule look at Dalrymple's vision of urban fantasy. Set in New York, his stories follow characters with wings, talking fish, giants, dwarves and other fantastical acquaintances and ideas. At the center of it all is a boy named Sinclair, who acquires a set of wings when a tattooed, disgruntled angel pays to have them cut off. Sinclair, a lonely kid prone to bowties and being teased, sets off on a series of encounters across the city. His older sister, a singer in a rock band, is an inspiration and worry; a homeless man of unknown powers and origins joins him; and a band of youths pursue him. Dalrymple renders this gang of eccentrics and mystics in a loose but realistic pen and ink style highly dynamic and tailor-made for depicting New York's teeming city streets. He has a flair for the dramatic as well scenes of Sinclair flying, or of a giant walking the streets, are genuinely affecting, while seeming completely natural and brings to life a subtle kind of cartoon surrealism. The story meanders a bit, and it's not always clear where it's headed, but the fun of Pop Gun War is in its vivid characters and details. It is a fine debut, reminiscent of DC Comics's Vertigo line, with which it should sit comfortably on bookstores' and adventurous readers' shelves. ...more",Image_Link:"http://books.toscrape.com/media/cache/6f/7b/6f7b3b8445b943f4ff7426360daefb88.jpg",Stars:1},{"":83,Title:"Political Suicide: Missteps, Peccadilloes, Bad Calls, Backroom Hijinx, Sordid Pasts, Rotten Breaks, and Just Plain Dumb Mistakes in the Annals of American Politics",Category:"History",Price:36.28,Price_After_Tax:36.28,Tax_amount:0,Avilability:16,Number_of_reviews:0,Book_Description:"Just in time for the presidential election of 2016 comes Political Suicide, a history of the best and most interesting missteps, peccadilloes, bad calls, back room hijinks, sordid pasts, rotten breaks, and just plain dumb mistakes in the annals of American politics.They have tweeted their private parts to women they're trying to impress.

Writer, prodigal daughter, single parent, Buddhist disciple, and, late in midlife, a newlywed, she is transformed through an unconventional relationship with a female spiritual teacher and an odd ritual of repeated tattooing with her two young adult children. "Christine Hale\'s evocation of the bewildering complexities of life as a mother, daughter, wife (and ex-wife), and student of Buddhism is both a poem and a letter to those she has worked so long and hard to understand. On a journey that takes her through emotional and actual hurricanes, love and cruelty, urgent losses, and painful gains, she climbs to sometimes unnervingly high altitudes as she experiences "the joy and the sorrow of samsara." In beautiful, clear language, Hale explores the wounds life gives us, the wounds we give ourselves, and the long process of healing." -Sarah Stone, author of The True Sources of the Nile Christine Hale is the author of a novel, Basil\'s Dream (Livingston Press 2009); National Book Award finalist Joan Silber says, "Basil\'s Dream...seems to prove fiction can go where other forms can\'t." Ms. Hale\'s creative nonfiction has appeared in Arts & Letters, Spry, Still, Hippocampus, and Prime Number, among other journals. A fellow of MacDowell, Ucross, Hedgebrook, and the Virginia Center for the Creative Arts, she earned her MFA from Warren Wilson College.

We feel unqualified to do God\xe2\x80\x99s work or to live out the calling we imagine. But God has a way of using our weaknesses for good. In fact, God loves unqualified people.In (Un)Qualified, Pastor Steven Furtick helps you peel back the assumptions you\xe2\x80\x99ve made about yourself and see yourself as God sees you. Because true peace and confidence come not from worldly perfection but from acceptance: God\xe2\x80\x99s acceptance of you, your acceptance of yourself, and your acceptance of God\xe2\x80\x99s process of change.This is a book about understanding your identity in light of who God is.

It\xe2\x80\x99s about charging into the gap between your present and your hopes and meeting God there. After all, God can\xe2\x80\x99t bless who you pretend to be.

The secret to our success is to appear as flawless as possible. But God\xe2\x80\x99s qualifying system is different than the world\xe2\x80\x99s. So is his view of our weaknesses, our purpose, and our true selves.In (Un)Qualified, Steven Furtick explores who God is as the great \xe2\x80\x9cI AM,\xe2\x80\x9d and then helps us discover our own identity. Delving into the story of Jacob, Furtick invites us to acknowledge our weaknesses and ask God to work through them.The truth is, God has created us to be more, to accomplish more, and to love life more than we ever thought possible. But to become who he has called us to be, we must embrace who we are right now. (Un)Qualified equips us to face obstacles and failures without losing a sense of purpose. We can have a thriving sense of hope that God is working in us and through us, not in spite of our weaknesses but often as a direct result of them. ...more",Image_Link:"http://books.toscrape.com/media/cache/e4/f8/e4f8c1c5954e09cb6c485d9db824eeb1.jpg",Stars:5},{"":128,Title:"You Are What You Love: The Spiritual Power of Habit",Category:"Religion",Price:21.87,Price_After_Tax:21.87,Tax_amount:0,Avilability:15,Number_of_reviews:0,Book_Description:"You are what you love.

And while we desire to shape culture, we are not often aware of how culture shapes us. We might not realize the ways our hearts are being taught to love rival gods instead of the One for whom we were made. Smith helps readers recognize the formative power of culture and the transformative possibilities of Christian practices. He explains that worship is the \"imagination station\" that incubates our loves and longings so that our cultural endeavors are indexed toward God and his kingdom. This is why the church and worshiping in a local community of believers should be the hub and heart of Christian formation and discipleship.Following the publication of his influential work Desiring the Kingdom, Smith received numerous requests from pastors and leaders for a more accessible version of that book's content. No mere abridgment, this new book draws on years of Smith's popular presentations on the ideas presented in Desiring the Kingdom to offer a fresh, bottom-up rearticulation. The author creatively uses film, literature, and music illustrations to engage readers and includes material on marriage, family, youth ministry, and faith and work. He also suggests individual and communal practices for shaping the Christian life. ...more",Image_Link:"http://books.toscrape.com/media/cache/52/9b/529bf0d806ae2ab02bf23da4326b24c3.jpg",Stars:4},{"":129,Title:"William Shakespeare's Star Wars: Verily, A New Hope (William Shakespeare's Star Wars #4)",Category:"Science Fiction",Price:43.3,Price_After_Tax:43.3,Tax_amount:0,Avilability:15,Number_of_reviews:0,Book_Description:"MAY THE VERSE BE WITH YOU!Return once more to a galaxy far, far away with this sublime retelling of George Lucas's epic Star Wars in the style of the immortal Bard of Avon.

Among them: James Bennett, a synesthetic art critic for The New York Times whose unlikely condition enables him to describe art in profound, magical ways, and Raul Engales, an exiled Argentinian painter running from his past and the Dirty War that has enveloped his country. As the two men ascend in the downtown arts scene, dual tragedies strike, and each is faced with a loss that acutely affects his relationship to life and to art. It is not until they are inadvertently brought together by Lucy Olliason\xe2\x80\x94a small town beauty and Raul\xe2\x80\x99s muse\xe2\x80\x94and a young orphan boy sent mysteriously from Buenos Aires, that James and Raul are able to rediscover some semblance of what they\xe2\x80\x99ve lost.As inventive as Jennifer Egan's A Visit From The Goon Squad and as sweeping as Meg Wolitzer's The Interestings, Tuesday Nights in 1980 boldly renders a complex moment when the meaning and nature of art is being all but upended, and New York City as a whole is reinventing itself.

Like their acclaimed bestseller George Washington's Secret Six, Thomas Jefferson and the Tripoli Pirates sheds new light on a vitally important episode that has been forgotten by most Americans. \xc2\xa0 Only weeks after President Jefferson's inauguration in 1801, he decided to confront the Tripoli pirates who had been kidnapping American ships and sailors, among other outrageous acts. Though inclined toward diplomacy, Jefferson sent warships to blockade Tripoli and protect American shipping, and then escalated to all-out war against the Barbary states. \xc2\xa0 The tiny American flotilla\xe2\x80\x94with three frigates representing half of the U.S. Navy\xe2\x80\x99s top-of-the-line ships\xe2\x80\x94had some success in blockading the Barbary coast. But that success came to an end when the USS\xc2\xa0Philadelphia\xc2\xa0ran aground in Tripoli harbor and was captured. Kilmeade and Yaeger recount the dramatic story of a young American sailor, Stephen Decatur, who snuck into the harbor, boarded the\xc2\xa0Philadelphia,\xc2\xa0and set her on fire before escaping amid a torrent of enemy gunfire. \xc2\xa0 Another amazing story is that of William Eaton\xe2\x80\x99s daring attack on the port city of Derna. He led a detachment of Marines on a 500-mile trek across the desert to surprise the port. His strategy worked, and an American flag was raised in victory on foreign soil for the first time. \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 Few remember Decatur and Eaton today, but their legacy inspired the opening of the\xc2\xa0Marine Corps Hymn: \xe2\x80\x9cFrom the halls of Montezuma to the shores of Tripoli, we fight our country\xe2\x80\x99s battles in the air, on land, and sea.\xe2\x80\x9d\xc2\xa0Thomas Jefferson and the Tripoli Pirates tells a dramatic story of bravery, diplomacy, and battle on the high seas, and honors some of America\xe2\x80\x99s forgotten heroes.\xc2\xa0 ...more",Image_Link:"http://books.toscrape.com/media/cache/77/79/777988a85de2269905bd8c2070a3cf58.jpg",Stars:1},{"":134,Title:"Thirteen Reasons Why",Category:"Default",Price:52.72,Price_After_Tax:52.72,Tax_amount:0,Avilability:15,Number_of_reviews:0,Book_Description:"Clay Jensen returns home from school to find a mysterious box with his name on it lying on his porch.

For the Posts, a two-week trip to the Balearic island of Mallorca with their extended family and friends is a celebration: Franny and Jim are observing their thirty-fifth wedding anniversary, and their daughter, Sylvia, has graduated from high school. The sunlit island, its mountains and beaches, its tapas and tennis courts, also promise an escape from the tensions simmering at home in Manhattan. But all does not go according to plan: over the course of the vacation, secrets come to light, old and new humiliations are experienced, childhood rivalries resurface, and ancient wounds are exacerbated. This is a story of the sides of ourselves that we choose to show and those we try to conceal, of the ways we tear each other down and build each other up again, and the bonds that ultimately hold us together. With wry humor and tremendous heart, Emma Straub delivers a richly satisfying story of a family in the midst of a maelstrom of change, emerging irrevocably altered yet whole. ...more",Image_Link:"http://books.toscrape.com/media/cache/34/c9/34c988a76c3cd7c04566d3030d8e7331.jpg",Stars:4},{"":138,Title:"The Third Wave: An Entrepreneur\xe2\x80\x99s Vision of the Future",Category:"Business",Price:12.61,Price_After_Tax:12.61,Tax_amount:0,Avilability:15,Number_of_reviews:0,Book_Description:"NEW YORK TIMES BESTSELLERWALL STREET JOURNAL BESTSELLEROne of America\xe2\x80\x99s most accomplished entrepreneurs\xe2\x80\x94a pioneer who made the Internet part of everyday life and orchestrated the largest merger in the history of business\xe2\x80\x94shares a roadmap for how anyone can succeed in a world of rapidly changing technology.Steve Case\xe2\x80\x99s career began when he cofounded America Online (AOL) in NEW YORK TIMES BESTSELLERWALL STREET JOURNAL BESTSELLEROne of America\xe2\x80\x99s most accomplished entrepreneurs\xe2\x80\x94a pioneer who made the Internet part of everyday life and orchestrated the largest merger in the history of business\xe2\x80\x94shares a roadmap for how anyone can succeed in a world of rapidly changing technology.Steve Case\xe2\x80\x99s career began when he cofounded America Online (AOL) in 1985. At the time, only three percent of Americans were online. It took a decade for AOL to achieve mainstream success, and there were many near-death experiences and back-to-the-wall pivots. AOL became the top performing company of the 1990s, and at its peak more than half of all consumer Internet traffic in the United States ran through the service. After Case engineered AOL\xe2\x80\x99s merger with Time Warner and he became Chairman of the combined business, Case oversaw the biggest media and communications empire in the world. In The Third Wave, which pays homage to the work of the futurist Alvin Toffler (from whom Case has borrowed the title, and whose work inspired him as a young man), Case takes us behind the scenes of some of the most consequential and riveting business decisions of our time while offering illuminating insights from decades of working as an entrepreneur, an investor, a philanthropist, and an advocate for sensible bipartisan policies. We are entering, as Case explains, a new paradigm called the \xe2\x80\x9cThird Wave\xe2\x80\x9d of the Internet. The first wave saw AOL and other companies lay the foundation for consumers to connect to the Internet. The second wave saw companies like Google and Facebook build on top of the Internet to create search and social networking capabilities, while apps like Snapchat and Instagram leverage the smartphone revolution. Now, Case argues, we\xe2\x80\x99re entering the Third Wave: a period in which entrepreneurs will vastly transform major \xe2\x80\x9creal world\xe2\x80\x9d sectors like health, education, transportation, energy, and food\xe2\x80\x94and in the process change the way we live our daily lives. But success in the Third Wave will require a different skill set, and Case outlines the path forward.The Third Wave is part memoir, part manifesto, and part playbook for the future. With passion and clarity, Case explains the ways in which newly emerging technology companies (a growing number of which, he argues, will not be based in Silicon Valley) will have to rethink their relationships with customers, with competitors, and with governments; and offers advice for how entrepreneurs can make winning business decisions and strategies\xe2\x80\x94and how all of us can make sense of this changing digital age. ...more",Image_Link:"http://books.toscrape.com/media/cache/0f/76/0f76b00ea914ced1822d8ac3480c485f.jpg",Stars:5},{"":139,Title:"The Stranger",Category:"Philosophy",Price:17.44,Price_After_Tax:17.44,Tax_amount:0,Avilability:15,Number_of_reviews:0,Book_Description:'This is an alternate cover edition for ISBN 0679720200.Through the story of an ordinary man unwittingly drawn into a senseless murder on an Algerian beach, Camus explored what he termed "the nakedness of man faced with the absurd."

Anthropologists call it the omnivore's dilemma. Choosing from among the countless potential foods nature offers, humans have had to learn what is safe, and what isn't\xe2\x80\x94which mushrooms should be avoided, for example, and which berries we can enjoy. Today, as America confronts what can only be described as a national eating disorder, the omnivore's dilemma has returned with an atavistic vengeance. The cornucopia of the modern American supermarket and fast-food outlet has thrown us back on a bewildering landscape where we once again have to worry about which of those tasty-looking morsels might kill us. At the same time we're realizing that our food choices also have profound implications for the health of our environment. The Omnivore's Dilemma is bestselling author Michael Pollan's brilliant and eye-opening exploration of these little-known but vitally important dimensions of eating in America. Pollan has divided The Omnivore's Dilemma into three parts, one for each of the food chains that sustain us: industrialized food, alternative or \"organic\" food, and food people obtain by dint of their own hunting, gathering, or gardening. Pollan follows each food chain literally from the ground up to the table, emphasizing our dynamic coevolutionary relationship with the species we depend on. He concludes each section by sitting down to a meal\xe2\x80\x94at McDonald's, at home with his family sharing a dinner from Whole Foods, and in a revolutionary \"beyond organic\" farm in Virginia. For each meal he traces the provenance of everything consumed, revealing the hidden components we unwittingly ingest and explaining how our taste for particular foods reflects our environmental and biological inheritance. We are indeed what we eat-and what we eat remakes the world. A society of voracious and increasingly confused omnivores, we are just beginning to recognize the profound consequences of the simplest everyday food choices, both for ourselves and for the natural world. The Omnivore's Dilemma is a long-overdue book and one that will become known for bringing a completely fresh perspective to a question as ordinary and yet momentous as What shall we have for dinner?A few facts and figures from The Omnivore's Dilemma:Of the 38 ingredients it takes to make a McNugget, there are at least 13 that are derived from corn. 45 different menu items at Mcdonald\xe2\x80\x99s are made from corn.

The apartment building in which the brutal crimes took place was already rundown, and in their aftermath a consensus developed in the community that it should be destroyed. It was a place, neighbors felt, that was plagued by spiritual cancer. In 2008, journalist Laura Tillman covered the story for The Brownsville Herald. The questions it raised haunted her, particularly one asked by the sole member of the city\xe2\x80\x99s Heritage Council to oppose demolition: is there any such thing as an evil building? Her investigation took her far beyond that question, revealing the nature of the toll that the crime exacted on a city already wracked with poverty. It sprawled into a six-year inquiry into the larger significance of such acts, ones so difficult to imagine or explain that their perpetrators are often dismissed as monsters alien to humanity. With meticulous attention and stunning compassion, Tillman surveyed those surrounding the crimes, speaking with the lawyers who tried the case, the family\xe2\x80\x99s neighbors and relatives and teachers, even one of the murderers: John Allen Rubio himself, whom she corresponded with for years and ultimately met in person. The result is a brilliant exploration of some of our age\xe2\x80\x99s most important social issues, from poverty to mental illness to the death penalty, and a beautiful, profound meditation on the truly human forces that drive them. It is disturbing, insightful, and mesmerizing in equal measure. ...more",Image_Link:"http://books.toscrape.com/media/cache/2b/50/2b50fa031b2411a94bc68de0bbdd96fb.jpg",Stars:1},{"":153,Title:"The Kite Runner",Category:"Default",Price:41.82,Price_After_Tax:41.82,Tax_amount:0,Avilability:15,Number_of_reviews:0,Book_Description:"Khaled Hosseini's #1 New York Times Bestselling Debut \xe2\x80\x9cIt may be unfair, but what happens in a few days, sometimes even a single day, can change the course of a whole lifetime.\" Amir is the son of a wealthy Kabul merchant, a member of the ruling caste of Pashtuns.

InThe Genius of Birds, Birds are astonishingly intelligent creatures. In fact, according to revolutionary new research, some birds rival primates and even humans in their remarkable forms of intelligence.\xc2\xa0 Like humans, many birds have enormous brains relative to their size. Although small, bird brains are packed with neurons that allow them to punch well above their weight. In\xc2\xa0The Genius of Birds, acclaimed author Jennifer Ackerman explores the newly discovered brilliance of birds and how it came about. As she travels around the world to the most cutting-edge frontiers of research\xe2\x80\x94 the distant laboratories of Barbados and New Caledonia, the great tit communities of the United Kingdom and the bowerbird habitats of Australia, the ravaged mid-Atlantic coast after Hurricane Sandy and the warming mountains of central Virginia and the western states\xe2\x80\x94Ackerman not only tells the story of the recently uncovered genius of birds but also delves deeply into the latest findings about the bird brain itself that are revolutionizing our view of what it means to be intelligent.Consider, as Ackerman does, the Clark\xe2\x80\x99s nutcracker, a bird that can hide as many as 30,000 seeds over dozens of square miles and remember where it put them several months later; the mockingbirds and thrashers, species that can store 200 to 2,000 different songs in a brain a thousand times smaller than ours; the well-known pigeon, which knows where it\xe2\x80\x99s going, even thousands of miles from familiar territory; and the New Caledonian crow, an impressive bird that makes its own tools. But beyond highlighting how birds use their unique genius in technical ways, Ackerman points out the impressive social smarts of birds. They deceive and manipulate. They eavesdrop. They display a strong sense of fairness. They give gifts. They play keep-away and tug-of-war. They tease. They share. They cultivate social networks. They vie for status. They kiss to console one another. They teach their young. They blackmail their parents. They alert one another to danger. They summon witnesses to the death of a peer. They may even grieve. This elegant scientific investigation and travelogue weaves personal anecdotes with fascinating science. Ackerman delivers an extraordinary story that will both give readers a new appreciation for the exceptional talents of birds and let them discover what birds can reveal about our changing world. Incredibly informative and beautifully written,\xc2\xa0The Genius of Birds\xc2\xa0richly celebrates the triumphs of these surprising and fiercely intelligent creatures. ...more",Image_Link:"http://books.toscrape.com/media/cache/2e/52/2e52982210cbc8dffe414cab72b52e38.jpg",Stars:1},{"":158,Title:"The Emerald Mystery",Category:"Default",Price:23.15,Price_After_Tax:23.15,Tax_amount:0,Avilability:15,Number_of_reviews:0,Book_Description:"Three young adults are invited to spend a weekend at the exotic Timber Island.

And yet John Quincy fell in love with her, almost despite himself. Their often tempestuous but deeply close marriage lasted half a century.\xc2\xa0 They lived in Prussia, Massachusetts, Washington, Russia, and England, at royal courts, on farms, in cities, and in the White House. Louisa saw more of Europe and America than nearly any other woman of her time. But wherever she lived, she was always pressing her nose against the glass, not quite sure whether she was looking in or out. The other members of the Adams family could take their identity for granted\xe2\x80\x94they were Adamses; they were Americans\xe2\x80\x94but she had to invent her own. The story of Louisa Catherine Adams is one of a woman who forged a sense of self. As the country her husband led found its place in the world, she found a voice. That voice resonates still.\xc2\xa0 In this deeply felt biography, the talented journalist and historian Louisa Thomas finally gives Louisa Catherine Adams's full extraordinary life its due. An intimate portrait of a remarkable woman, a complicated marriage, and a pivotal historical moment, Louisa Thomas's biography is a masterful work from an elegant storyteller. ...more",Image_Link:"http://books.toscrape.com/media/cache/ec/2a/ec2a7df6fdafc7e6f97b6c6da7980584.jpg",Stars:2},{"":183,Title:"Little Red",Category:"Childrens",Price:13.47,Price_After_Tax:13.47,Tax_amount:0,Avilability:15,Number_of_reviews:0,Book_Description:"On her way to Grandmas house, Little Red Riding Hood meets a wolf.

The heart of her work on her national public radio program and podcast,\xc2\xa0On Being, has been to shine a light on people whose insights kindle in us a sense of wonder and courage. Scientists in a variety of fields; theologians from an array of faiths; poets, activists, and many others have all opened themselves up to Tippett's compassionate yet searching conversation. \xc2\xa0 In\xc2\xa0Becoming Wise, Tippett distills the insights she has gleaned from this luminous conversation in its many dimensions into a coherent narrative journey, over time and from mind to mind. The book is a master class in living, curated by Tippett and accompanied by a delightfully ecumenical dream team of teaching faculty. \xc2\xa0 The open questions and challenges of our time are intimate and civilizational all at once, Tippett says \xe2\x80\x93 definitions of when life begins and when death happens, of the meaning of community and family and identity, of our relationships to technology and through technology. The wisdom we seek emerges through the raw materials of the everyday. And the enduring question of what it means to be human has now become inextricable from the question of who we are to each other. \xc2\xa0 This book offers a grounded and fiercely hopeful vision of humanity for this century \xe2\x80\x93 of personal growth but also renewed public life and human spiritual evolution. It insists on the possibility of a common life for this century marked by resilience and redemption, with beauty as a core moral value and civility and love as muscular practice. Krista Tippett's great gift, in her work and in Becoming Wise, is to avoid reductive simplifications but still find the golden threads that weave people and ideas together into a shimmering braid. \xc2\xa0 One powerful common denominator of the lessons imparted to Tippett is the gift of presence, of the exhilaration of engagement with life for its own sake, not as a means to an end. But presence does not mean passivity or acceptance of the status quo. Indeed Tippett and her teachers are people whose work meets, and often drives, powerful forces of change alive in the world today. In the end, perhaps the greatest blessing conveyed by the lessons of spiritual genius Tippett harvests in\xc2\xa0Becoming Wise\xc2\xa0is the strength to meet the world where it really is, and then to make it better. ...more",Image_Link:"http://books.toscrape.com/media/cache/33/65/3365a493bba6856798437c3e341a1e5d.jpg",Stars:2},{"":206,Title:"Beauty Restored (Riley Family Legacy Novellas #3)",Category:"Default",Price:11.11,Price_After_Tax:11.11,Tax_amount:0,Avilability:15,Number_of_reviews:0,Book_Description:"While volunteering at a youth camp in the Ozark Mountains, Carmen Riley sponsors a challenging group of teenage girls.

Stepping over the lines imposed by rigid conviction, she draws on philosophy, theology, psychology, science, and more to explore, with curiosity and passion, the vital role of mystery in a deceptively information-rich world; to ask what we mean by the search for meaning; to invoke the humbling yet elating perspective of infinity; to challenge received ideas about death; and to reconsider what \xe2\x80\x9cthe soul\xe2\x80\x9d might be.

Scores of Jewish prophets, preachers, and would-be messiahs wandered through the Holy Land, bearing messages from God. This was the age of zealotry\xe2\x80\x94a fervent nationalism that made resistance to the Roman occupation a sacred duty incumbent on all Jews. And few figures better exemplified this principle than the charismatic Galilean who defied both the imperial authorities and their allies in the Jewish religious hierarchy.Balancing the Jesus of the Gospels against the historical sources, Aslan describes a man full of conviction and passion, yet rife with contradiction; a man of peace who exhorted his followers to arm themselves with swords; an exorcist and faith healer who urged his disciples to keep his identity a secret; and ultimately the seditious \xe2\x80\x9cKing of the Jews\xe2\x80\x9d whose promise of liberation from Rome went unfulfilled in his brief lifetime. Aslan explores the reasons why the early Christian church preferred to promulgate an image of Jesus as a peaceful spiritual teacher rather than a politically conscious revolutionary. And he grapples with the riddle of how Jesus understood himself, the mystery that is at the heart of all subsequent claims about his divinity.Zealot yields a fresh perspective on one of the greatest stories ever told even as it affirms the radical and transformative nature of Jesus of Nazareth\xe2\x80\x99s life and mission. The result is a thought-provoking, elegantly written biography with the pulse of a fast-paced novel: a singularly brilliant portrait of a man, a time, and the birth of a religion. ...more",Image_Link:"http://books.toscrape.com/media/cache/21/da/21dab5c065cfcde1bad7ded16a753102.jpg",Stars:3},{"":216,Title:"You (You #1)",Category:"Thriller",Price:43.61,Price_After_Tax:43.61,Tax_amount:0,Avilability:14,Number_of_reviews:0,Book_Description:"When a beautiful, aspiring writer strides into the East Village bookstore where Joe Goldberg works, he does what anyone would do: he Googles the name on her credit card.There is only one Guinevere Beck in New York City.

Its core contention is that American conservatism and the Republican Party took a wrong turn when they adopted Barry Goldwater\xe2\x80\x99s worldview during and after the 1964 campaign. The radicalism of today\xe2\x80\x99s conservatism is not the product of the Tea Party, Washington Post columnist E.J. Dionne writes. The Tea Partiers are the true heirs to Goldwater ideology. The purity movement did more than drive moderates out of the Republican Party\xe2\x80\x94it beat back alternative definitions of conservatism.Since 1968, no conservative administration\xe2\x80\x94not Nixon not Reagan not two Bushes\xe2\x80\x94could live up to the rhetoric rooted in the Goldwater movement that began to reshape American politics fifty years ago. The collapse of the Nixon presidency led to the rise of Ronald Reagan, the defeat of George H.W. Bush, to Newt Gingrich\xe2\x80\x99s revolution. Bush initially undertook a partial modernization, preaching \xe2\x80\x9ccompassionate conservatism\xe2\x80\x9d and a \xe2\x80\x9cFourth Way\xe2\x80\x9d to Clinton\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9cThird Way.\xe2\x80\x9d Conservatives quickly defined him as an advocate of \xe2\x80\x9cbig government\xe2\x80\x9d and not conservative enough on spending, immigration, education, and Medicare. A return to the true faith was the only prescription on order. The result was the Tea Party, which Dionne says, was as much a reaction to Bush as to Obama.The state of the Republican party, controlled by the strictest base, is diminished, Dionne writes. It has become white and older in a country that is no longer that. It needs to come back to life for its own health and that of the country\xe2\x80\x99s, and in Why the Right Went Wrong, he explains how. ...more",Image_Link:"http://books.toscrape.com/media/cache/cd/64/cd64ccda3382d62fea8167eaadd6c9a0.jpg",Stars:4},{"":220,Title:"Whole Lotta Creativity Going On: 60 Fun and Unusual Exercises to Awaken and Strengthen Your Creativity",Category:"Nonfiction",Price:38.2,Price_After_Tax:38.2,Tax_amount:0,Avilability:14,Number_of_reviews:0,Book_Description:"Be your own kind of creative.

As a teenager, he had channeled his defiance into running, discovering a prodigious talent that had carried him to the Berlin Olympics and within sight of the four-minute mile.

Days later - the night before New Year's Eve - the Dunnes were just sitting down to dinner after visiting the hospital when John suffered a massive and fatal coronary.In a second, this close, symbiotic partnership of 40 years was over. Four weeks later, their daughter pulled through. Two months after that, arriving at LA airport, she collapsed and underwent six hours of brain surgery at UCLA Medical Centre to relieve a massive hematoma.This powerful book is Didion's 'attempt to make sense of the weeks and then months that cut loose any fixed idea I ever had about death, about illness, about marriage and children and memory, about the shallowness of sanity, about life itself'. The result is an exploration of an intensely personal yet universal experience: a portrait of a marriage, and a life, in good times and bad. ...more",Image_Link:"http://books.toscrape.com/media/cache/06/2a/062af372ae666a16fa7e67ced2d1187c.jpg",Stars:2},{"":231,Title:"The Wright Brothers",Category:"Default",Price:56.8,Price_After_Tax:56.8,Tax_amount:0,Avilability:14,Number_of_reviews:0,Book_Description:"Two-time winner of the Pulitzer Prize David McCullough tells the dramatic story-behind-the-story about the courageous brothers who taught the world how to fly: Wilbur and Orville Wright.On a winter day in 1903, in the Outer Banks of North Carolina, two unknown brothers from Ohio changed history.

But it would take the world some time to believe what had happened: the age of flight had begun, with the first heavier-than-air, powered machine carrying a pilot.Who were these men and how was it that they achieved what they did?David McCullough, two-time winner of the Pulitzer Prize, tells the surprising, profoundly American story of Wilbur and Orville Wright.Far more than a couple of unschooled Dayton bicycle mechanics who happened to hit on success, they were men of exceptional courage and determination, and of far-ranging intellectual interests and ceaseless curiosity, much of which they attributed to their upbringing. The house they lived in had no electricity or indoor plumbing, but there were books aplenty, supplied mainly by their preacher father, and they never stopped reading.When they worked together, no problem seemed to be insurmountable. Wilbur was unquestionably a genius. Orville had such mechanical ingenuity as few had ever seen. That they had no more than a public high school education, little money and no contacts in high places, never stopped them in their mission to take to the air. Nothing did, not even the self-evident reality that every time they took off in one of their contrivances, they risked being killed.In this thrilling book, master historian David McCullough draws on the immense riches of the Wright Papers, including private diaries, notebooks, scrapbooks, and more than a thousand letters from private family correspondence to tell the human side of the Wright Brothers' story, including the little-known contributions of their sister, Katharine, without whom things might well have gone differently for them. ...more",Image_Link:"http://books.toscrape.com/media/cache/51/98/51985c3a61a47b8de85239b9e3b2a938.jpg",Stars:4},{"":232,Title:"The White Queen (The Cousins' War #1)",Category:"Add a comment",Price:25.91,Price_After_Tax:25.91,Tax_amount:0,Avilability:14,Number_of_reviews:0,Book_Description:"Philippa Gregory presents the first of a new series set amid the deadly feuds of England known as the Wars of the Roses.Brother turns on brother to win the ultimate prize, the throne of England, in this dazzling account of the wars of the Plantagenets.

Sent overseas on a critical assignment, he fails, unable to pull the trigger. Absent his talents, Robie is a man without a mission, and without a purpose.To recover what he has lost, Robie must confront what he has tried to forget for over twenty years: his own past. THE GUILTY Will Robie escaped his small Gulf Coast hometown of Cantrell, Mississippi after high school, severing all personal ties, and never looked back. Not once. Not until the unimaginable occurs. His father, Dan Robie, has been arrested and charged with murder.Father and son haven't spoken or seen each other since the day Robie left town. In that time, Dan Robie - a local attorney and pillar of the community-has been elected town judge. Despite this, most of Cantrell is aligned against Dan. His guilt is assumed.To make matters worse, Dan has refused to do anything to defend himself. When Robie tries to help, his father responds only with anger and defiance. Could Dan really be guilty?With the equally formidable Jessica Reel at his side, Robie ignores his father's wishes and begins his own desperate investigation into the case. But Robie is now a stranger to his hometown, an outsider, a man who has forsaken his past and his family. His attempts to save his father are met with distrust and skepticism . . . and violence.Unlike the missions Robie undertook in the service of his country, where his target was clearly defined, digging into his father's case only reveals more questions. Robie is drawn into the hidden underside of Cantrell, where he must face the unexpected and possibly deadly consequences of the long-ago choices made by father and son. And this time, there may be no escape for either of them. ...more",Image_Link:"http://books.toscrape.com/media/cache/7f/fd/7ffdc9c4b7bf965990c59460da9b66b7.jpg",Stars:2},{"":251,Title:"The First Hostage (J.B.

Whether it's Horse meat in our burgers, melamine in our infant formula, artificial colors in our fish and fruit--as our urban lifestyle takes us farther away from our food sources, there are increasing opportunities for dishonesty, duplicity, and profit-making shortcuts. Food adulteration, motivated by money, is an issue that has spanned the globe throughout human history. Whether it's a matter of making a good quality oil stretch a bit further by adding a little extra \"something\" or labeling a food falsely to appeal to current consumer trends--it's all food fraud. Consumers may pay the ultimate costs for these crimes, with their health and, in some cases, their lives. So how do we sort the beef from the bull (or horse, as the case may be)?Illustrious analytical chemist Richard Evershed and science writer Nicola Temple explain the scientific tools and techniques that have revealed the century's biggest food fraud scams. They explore the arms race between scientists and adulterators as better techniques for detection spur more creative and sophisticated means of adulteration, and review the up-and-coming techniques and devices that will help the industry and consumers fight food fraud in the future. Engagingly written, SORTING THE BEEF FROM THE BULL lifts the lid on the forensics involved, and brings to light the full story of a fascinating and underreported world of applied science. ...more",Image_Link:"http://books.toscrape.com/media/cache/5d/a5/5da545b9d44464af8b3d0a9511a050ca.jpg",Stars:4},{"":265,Title:"Someone Like You (The Harrisons #2)",Category:"Contemporary",Price:52.79,Price_After_Tax:52.79,Tax_amount:0,Avilability:14,Number_of_reviews:0,Book_Description:"Pierce Harrison--yes, that Pierce Harrison, black sheep of the wealthy Harrison clan--has come home to his family's luxurious Long Island compound.

Rob and Renee's life together - they wed after graduate school, both became music journalists, and were married only five years when Renee died suddenly on Mother's Day, 1997 - is shared through the window of the mix tapes they obsessively compiled. There are mixes to court each other, mixes for road trips, mixes for doing the dishes, mixes for sleeping - and, eventually, mixes to mourn Rob's greatest loss. The tunes were among the great musical output of the early 1990s - Pearl Jam, Nirvana, Pavement, Yo La Tengo, REM, Weezer - as well as classics by The Rolling Stones, The Beatles, Aretha Franklin and more.

Aided by a prescient cat, he becomes \xe2\x80\x9cDoctor Sleep.\xe2\x80\x9dThen Dan meets the evanescent Abra Stone, and it is her spectacular gift, the brightest shining ever seen, that reignites Dan\xe2\x80\x99s own demons and summons him to a battle for Abra\xe2\x80\x99s soul and survival. This is an epic war between good and evil, a gory, glorious story that will thrill the millions of devoted readers of The Shining and satisfy anyone new to the territory of this icon in the King canon. ...more",Image_Link:"http://books.toscrape.com/media/cache/30/05/30053f9d8549febc67059c52fca65744.jpg",Stars:2},{"":315,Title:"Demigods & Magicians: Percy and Annabeth Meet the Kanes (Percy Jackson & Kane Chronicles Crossover #1-3)",Category:"Fantasy",Price:37.51,Price_After_Tax:37.51,Tax_amount:0,Avilability:14,Number_of_reviews:0,Book_Description:"Magic, monsters, and mayhem abound when Percy Jackson and Annabeth Chase meet Carter and Sadie Kane for the first time.

Cell, the king of horror's homage to zombie films (the book is dedicated in part to George A. Romero) is his goriest, most horrific novel in years, not to mention the most intensely paced. Casting aside his love of elaborate character and town histories and penchant for delayed gratification, King yanks readers off their feet within the first few pages; dragging them into the fray and offering no chance catch their breath until the very last page. In Cell King taps into readers fears of technological warfare and terrorism. Mobile phones deliver the apocalypse to millions of unsuspecting humans by wiping their brains of any humanity, leaving only aggressive and destructive impulses behind. Those without cell phones, like illustrator Clayton Riddell and his small band of \"normies,\" must fight for survival, and their journey to find Clayton's estranged wife and young son rockets the book toward resolution. Fans that have followed King from the beginning will recognize and appreciate Cell as a departure--King's writing has not been so pure of heart and free of hang-ups in years (wrapping up his phenomenal Dark Tower series and receiving a medal from the National Book Foundation doesn't hurt either). \"Retirement\" clearly suits King, and lucky for us, having nothing left to prove frees him up to write frenzied, juiced-up horror-thrillers like Cell.

Walker explores this changing cultural landscape\xe2\x80\x93including a practice he calls \xe2\x80\x9cmurketing,\xe2\x80\x9d blending the terms murky and marketing\xe2\x80\x93by introducing us to the creative marketers, entrepreneurs, artists, and community organizers who have found a way to thrive within it. Using profiles of brands old and new, including Timberland, American Apparel, Pabst Blue Ribbon, Red Bull, iPod, and Livestrong, Walker demonstrates the ways in which buyers adopt products, not just as consumer choices, but as conscious expressions of their identities. Part marketing primer, part work of cultural anthropology, Buying In reveals why now, more than ever, we are what we buy\xe2\x80\x93and vice versa. Praise for Buying In \xe2\x80\x9cWalker \xe2\x80\xa6 makes a startling claim: Far from being immune to advertising, as many people think, American consumers are increasingly active participants in the marketing process. \xe2\x80\xa6 [He] leads readers through a series of lucid case studies to demonstrate that, in many cases, consumers actively participate in infusing a brand with meaning. \xe2\x80\xa6 Convincing.\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x94 Jay Dixit, The Washington Post \xe2\x80\x9cWalker lays out his theory in well-written, entertaining detail.\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x94 Seth Stevenson, Slate \xe2\x80\x9cBuying In delves into the attitudes of the global consumer in the age of plenty, and, well, we aren\xe2\x80\x99t too pretty. Walker carries the reader on a frenetically paced tour of senseless consumption spanning from Viking ranges to custom high-tops.\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x94 Robert Blinn, Core77 \xe2\x80\x9cRob Walker is one smart shopper.\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x94 Jen Trolio, ReadyMade \xe2\x80\x9cThe most trenchant psychoanalyst of our consumer selves is Rob Walker. This is a fresh and fascinating exploration of the places where material culture and identity intersect.\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x93Michael Pollan, author of In Defense of Food \xe2\x80\x9cThis book has vast social implications, far beyond the fields of marketing and branding. It obliterates our old paradigm of companies (the bad guys) corrupting our children (the innocents) via commercials. In this new world, media-literate young people freely and willingly co-opt the brands, and most companies are clueless bystanders desperate to keep up. I really don't know if this is good news or bad news, but I can say, with certainty, that this book is a must-read.\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x93Po Bronson, author of What Should I Do with My Life? \xe2\x80\x9cRob Walker is a gift. He shows that in our shattered, scattered world, powerful brands are existential, insinuating themselves into the human questions \xe2\x80\x98What am I about?\xe2\x80\x99 and \xe2\x80\x98How do I connect?\xe2\x80\x99 His insight that brand influence is becoming both more pervasive and more hidden\xe2\x80\x93that we are not so self-defined as we like to think\xe2\x80\x93should make us disturbed, and vigilant.\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x93Jim Collins, author of Good to Great\xe2\x80\x9cRob Walker is a terrific writer\xc2\xa0who understands both human nature and the business world. His book is highly entertaining, but it\xe2\x80\x99s also a deeply thoughtful look at the ways in which marketing meets the modern psyche.\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x93Bethany McLean, editor at large, Fortune, and co-author of The Smartest Guys in the Room\xe2\x80\x9cAre we living in an era of YouTube-empowered, brand-rejecting consumers? Rob Walker has the surprising answers, and you won\xe2\x80\x99t want to miss this joyride through the front lines of consumer culture. A marketing must-read.\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x93Chip Heath and Dan Heath, authors of Made to Stick \xe2\x80\x9cRob Walker brilliantly deconstructs the religion of consumption.
